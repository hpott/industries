# Industries

Industries is a [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) theme I made for my website, [hugoindustries.xyz](http://hugoindustries.xyz/). For styles I used the Bootstrap CSS library and some of my own CSS. 

## Installation

Add this repository as a Submodule in the themes/ directory of your Hugo project
```bash
git add submodule https:/github.com/hpott/industries.git
```
